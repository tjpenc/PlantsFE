# Plants
## Overview
  This full stack app is for the hobby gardener who needs to keep track of the many tasks, plants, and beds that they have. A user is able to create tasks and set deadlines for themselves, and mark when the tasks have been completed. A user can also create plants to keep track of what plants they have in their inventory or even any plants they may want to own in the future. Further, this app acts as a raised bed planner. A user can use the plants they have created, and plan out a raised bed with those plants. All data is user specific, so you will never encounter another users data.
